# Vernier

Next-generation Ruby 3.2.1+ sampling profiler. Tracks multiple threads, GVL activity, GC pauses, idle time, and more.

## Installation

Vernier requires Ruby version 3.2.1 or greater and a Unix-like operating system.

```ruby
gem "vernier", "~> 1.0"
```

## Usage

The output can be viewed in the web app at https://vernier.prof, locally using the [`profile-viewer` gem](https://github.com/tenderlove/profiler/tree/ruby) (both lightly customized versions of the firefox profiler frontend which profiles are compatible with), or by using the `vernier view` command in the CLI.

- **Flame Graph**: Shows proportionally how much time is spent within particular stack frames. Frames are grouped together, which means that x-axis / left-to-right order is not meaningful.
- **Stack Chart**: Shows the stack at each sample with the x-axis representing time and can be read left-to-right.

### Time and Allocations

#### Command line

The easiest way to record a program or script is via the CLI:

```sh
$ vernier run -- ruby -e 'sleep 1'
starting profiler with interval 500 and allocation interval 0
#<Vernier::Result 1.001589 seconds, 1 threads, 1 samples, 1 unique>
written to /tmp/profile20240328-82441-gkzffc.vernier.json.gz
```

```sh
$ vernier run --interval 100 --allocation-interval 10 -- ruby -e '10.times { Object.new }'
starting profiler with interval 100 and allocation interval 10
#<Vernier::Result 0.00067 seconds, 1 threads, 1 samples, 1 unique>
written to /tmp/profile20241029-26525-dalmym.vernier.json.gz
```

#### Block of code

``` ruby
Vernier.profile(out: "time_profile.json") do
  some_slow_method
end
```

``` ruby
Vernier.profile(out: "time_profile.json", interval: 100, allocation_interval: 10) do
  some_slow_method
end
```

Alternatively you can use the aliases `Vernier.run` and `Vernier.trace`.

#### Start and stop

```ruby
Vernier.start_profile(out: "time_profile.json", interval: 10_000, allocation_interval: 100_000)

some_slow_method

# some other file

some_other_slow_method

Vernier.stop_profile
```

#### Rack middleware

You can also use `Vernier::Middleware` to profile a Rack application:

```ruby
# config.ru

require "vernier"

use Vernier::Middleware

run ->(env) { [200, { "Content-Type" => "text/plain" }, ["Hello, Profiling World!"]] }
```

If you're using Rails, you can add the middleware to your `config/application.rb`:

```ruby
config.middleware.use Vernier::Middleware, permit: ->(env) { env["PATH_INFO"].start_with?("/api") }
```

You can then enable profiling and configure options with query parameters:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000?vernier=true&vernier_interval=100&vernier_allocation_interval=10
```

### Retained memory

#### Block of code

Record a flamegraph of all **retained** allocations from loading `irb`:

```sh
ruby -r vernier -e 'Vernier.trace_retained(out: "irb_profile.json") { require "irb" }'
```

> [!NOTE]
> Retained-memory flamegraphs must be interpreted a little differently than a typical profiling flamegraph. In a retained-memory flamegraph, the x-axis represents a proportion of memory in bytes,  _not time or samples_ The topmost boxes on the y-axis represent the retained objects, with their stacktrace below; their width represents the percentage of overall retained memory each object occupies.

### Options

Option \| Middleware Param | Description | Default \| Middleware Default
:- | :- | :-
`mode` \| N/A | The sampling mode to use. One of `:wall`, `:retained` or `:custom`. | `:wall` \| `:wall`
`out` \| N/A | The file to write the profile to. | N/A \| Automatically generated
`interval` \| `vernier_interval` | The sampling interval in microseconds. Only available in `:wall` mode. | `500` \| `200`
`allocation_interval` \| `vernier_allocation_interval` | The allocation sampling interval in number of allocations. Only available in `:wall` mode. | `0` (disabled) \| `200`
`gc` \| N/A | Initiate a full and immediate garbage collection cycle before profiling. Only available in `:retained` mode. | `true` \| N/A

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
